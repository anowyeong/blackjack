# Blackjack
This is a fun Poker game also known as 21. No real money is involved so don't worry about getting bankrupted. This is a single player game and it's just you against the dealer. The rules are the standard rules like in a casino. Dealer hits on a hand with 16 or less.

# Motivation
I thought it would be a great idea for people who don't like to gamble to still be able to enjoy this game. It's a great way to think of the many combinations of hands you can have, which only grows based on the number of decks you've decided to use. Test or luck or even your skills. 

# How to use
Currently there is no GUI, so you would have to run this with an IDE or in terminal.
